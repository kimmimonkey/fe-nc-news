# NC News Front End Project

This project is an example of my front end development skills. I've created a Reddit-inspired aricle web app which pulls data from the API I built in my NC News project (https://github.com/kimmimonkey/nc-news).

## Key Features:

### React
The project is a built in React and it uses RESTful pathways.

### Two view modes
The app loads in dark or light mode, depending on the user's browser settings.  

### Toggled Comments 
Sometimes, reading comments is not what a user wants. The app loads with the comment section hidden by default, but this can be toggled on at the the touch of a button.  

## Getting Started 
First, clone the repo from https://github.com/kimmimonkey/fe-nc-news. You'll need to install the relevant dependencies using the command npm install or npm i.
